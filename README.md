# car-traversal-project

Simple project that uses the Executor Threads to make objects of the type "Car" traverse a graph.

## Still Todo

* Reformat the way i populate the graph. Either streaming from a file or perhaps from a database.
* Create an overarching class of "Vehicle" for Dependancy Injection. 
* Rewrite Car classes for a more cleaner code ( and less dependant) code.
